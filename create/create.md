    * Indicate that your project is a __create project__
* __Make sure to include a link to your source code repository in the "try it out" section__
* If you are submitting to any particular prizes, make sure to describe why you believe your submission is eligible, and also mark them on your submission.

###  Be ready to explain during the project expo:
* __Thought process and inspiration__ for your project
* __Potential uses and benefits of your project__ 
* __Issues__ you faced
* __Major decision making__, such as the selection of technical frameworks, languages, code structure, etc.
* Your selection of __FOSS license__ in your README.md

###  Above and beyond:
* __Incorporate tests__ into your project
* Provide a link to a __packaged release__
